2. **Phase 31 → Phase 35**: SerpAPI/Jobicy rate limiters configured and shared ✓
3. **Phase 31 → Phase 36**: _cleanup_connections() called before file deletion ✓
4. **Phase 33 → Phase 34**: DEFAULT_SCORING_WEIGHTS exported and consumed by GUI ✓
5. **Phase 33 → Scoring**: staffing_preference applied in score_job() ✓
6. **Phase 34 → Main GUI**: ScoringConfigWidget integrated into Settings tab ✓
7. **Phase 35 → Main GUI**: Quota display updates after searches ✓
8. **Phase 36 → Main GUI**: Uninstall dialogs orchestrated in Settings tab ✓

---

## Test Coverage

**Total Tests:** 566 tests across 19 test files (all passing)

**Coverage Areas:**
- scoring, config, tracker, wizard, report, UX, API, PDF, dedup, accessibility
- profile management, GUI, rate limiting, JSearch, USAJobs, schema migration
- scoring config widget, uninstaller

**Code Stats:**
- ~20,450 LOC Python (source + tests + GUI)
- 9 GUI modules (3,899 LOC)
- Zero regressions across milestone transitions

---

## Manual Verification Recommended

While all automated checks passed, the following require human observation:

**Phase 37 (Installers):**
1. macOS DMG visual appearance and drag-drop experience
2. Windows NSIS wizard flow and shortcuts creation
3. CI/CD installer builds on tag push
4. macOS Gatekeeper bypass instructions (right-click → Open)
5. Windows SmartScreen bypass instructions (More info → Run anyway)

These are standard installer UX validations requiring visual inspection of OS dialogs and behaviors.

  - Three-phase ordering ensures native sources win in dedup

✓ **Staffing Firm Control:**
  - User-configurable preference (Boost/Neutral/Penalize)
  - Backend schema migration to v2
  - GUI controls with live preview
  - Applied correctly in scoring engine

✓ **Clean Uninstall:**
  - GUI uninstall button with backup option
