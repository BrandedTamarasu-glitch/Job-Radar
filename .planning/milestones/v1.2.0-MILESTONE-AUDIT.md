## End-to-End Flow Verification

### Flow 1: API Setup → Credential Loading → Job Search ✓

**Status:** COMPLETE

```
--setup-apis → Interactive prompts → .env written
--test-apis → Load credentials → HTTP validation → Pass/Fail feedback
Normal search → load_api_credentials() → fetch_all() → API sources included
```

**Verified:**
- Credentials loaded before API fetching
- API fetchers check credentials and rate limits
- Missing credentials skip source gracefully
- Rate limits prevent 429 errors

### Flow 2: Job Search → Data Extraction → Deduplication → Report ✓

**Status:** COMPLETE

```
Query → build_search_queries() → Scrapers + APIs
Scrapers first → API sources second (sequential)
Each API result → Mapper → JobResult with salary data
All results → deduplicate_cross_source() → Fuzzy matching
Report → Display salary data → Group manual URLs by source
```

**Verified:**
- Sequential scraper-then-API flow
- Mappers use text utilities for cleaning
- Location normalization applied
- Salary data extracted and displayed
- Cross-source deduplication with 85% threshold
- Wellfound appears first in manual URLs

### Flow 3: PDF Onboarding → Extraction → Pre-fill → Profile ✓

**Status:** COMPLETE

```
First run → Wizard → PDF_SUPPORT check
Upload choice → Path prompt → Validation
extract_resume_data() → Parse name/years/titles/skills
Disclaimer → Pre-fill wizard prompts (editable)
User edits → Save profile.json
```

**Verified:**
- PDF feature hidden when pdfplumber missing
- Upload offered as first wizard choice
- Validation rejects problematic PDFs with clear errors
- Extracted data pre-fills with sanity checks
- User can edit all pre-filled values
- Manual fallback on all error paths

## Human Verification Recommendations

While all automated checks pass, the following manual testing is recommended for production readiness:

### Phase 12-13: API Integration
1. **Real API credentials testing:** Run --setup-apis with actual Adzuna and Authentic Jobs accounts, verify API calls succeed
2. **Rate limiting under load:** Make 100+ API calls rapidly, verify rate limit enforcement prevents 429 errors
3. **Error recovery:** Test network failures, 401/403 errors, verify graceful degradation

### Phase 14: Wellfound URLs
1. **URL validity:** Open generated Wellfound URLs in browser, verify search results match role and location
2. **Remote vs location patterns:** Verify /role/r/ shows remote jobs, /role/l/ shows location-specific jobs

### Phase 15: PDF Resume Parser
1. **Real resume diversity:** Upload 5-10 real PDFs with varied formats, verify extraction quality
2. **UTF-8 international names:** Upload resumes with accented names (José, François), verify correct display
3. **PyInstaller executable:** Build with PyInstaller on clean system, verify PDF parsing works without Python installed
4. **Error recovery:** Test encrypted PDF → error → manual fallback flow
