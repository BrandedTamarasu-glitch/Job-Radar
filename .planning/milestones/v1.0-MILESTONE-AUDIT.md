# v1.0 Milestone Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-09T17:00:00Z
**Status:** ✓ PASSED
**Re-audit:** Yes (after Phase 5 gap closure)

## Executive Summary

All 17 v1.0 requirements satisfied. All 5 phases verified and fully integrated. Core E2E flows work correctly. System is production-ready.

**Previous tech debt resolved:** Phase 5 added explicit fuzzy variant matching tests (6 parametrized test cases covering all 4 audit-identified variant pairs).

**Remaining tech debt:** Minimal - no integration test for two-pass config parsing (lower priority, unit tests cover components), two future-feature functions in tracker.py.

## Requirements Coverage: 17/17 (100%)

**Fuzzy Matching (Phase 1):** 5/5 ✓
- FUZZ-01: _normalize_skill() strips punctuation, lowercases, collapses whitespace
- FUZZ-02: Normalized lookup so "NodeJS" matches "node.js"
- FUZZ-03: _BOUNDARY_SKILLS protection preserved for short skills
- FUZZ-04: Zero regressions on existing _SKILL_VARIANTS
- FUZZ-05: Expanded _SKILL_VARIANTS with 16+ common tech variants

**Config Support (Phase 2):** 5/5 ✓
- CONF-01: JSON config file at ~/.job-radar/config.json
- CONF-02: CLI flags always override config values
- CONF-03: Graceful behavior when no config exists
- CONF-04: --config flag for custom config path
- CONF-05: Config validation with helpful error messages

**Test Suite (Phase 3):** 7/7 ✓
- TEST-01: Scoring unit tests cover all _score_* functions
- TEST-02: Dealbreaker detection tests (exact, substring, case-insensitive)
- TEST-03: Salary parsing tests (all formats)
- TEST-04: Tracker job_key() tests verify stable dedup keys
- TEST-05: Tracker mark_seen() tests with tmp_path isolation
- TEST-06: Tracker get_stats() tests verify aggregation
- TEST-07: Shared conftest.py with fixtures

**Config Tests (Phase 4):** Tech debt closure ✓
- 24 unit tests for config module covering all edge cases
- Missing file, invalid JSON, non-dict JSON, unknown keys, path expansion
- All tests use tmp_path isolation and capsys for stderr validation

**Test Coverage Completion (Phase 5):** Gap closure ✓
- 6 parametrized cross-variant tests added
- All 4 audit-identified variant pairs covered: node.js/NodeJS, kubernetes/k8s, .NET/dotnet, C#/csharp
- 2 bonus variants: python/python3, go/golang
- Zero regressions (72 → 78 total tests, all pass)

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Plans | Verification | Must-Haves | Requirements |
|-------|-------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| 1. Fuzzy Skill Normalization | 2/2 | Passed (re-verified) | 8/8 | FUZZ-01 to FUZZ-05 |
| 2. Config File Support | 1/1 | Passed | 5/5 | CONF-01 to CONF-05 |
| 3. Test Suite | 2/2 | Passed | 10/10 | TEST-01 to TEST-07 |
| 4. Config Module Unit Tests | 1/1 | Passed | 7/7 | Tech debt closure |
| 5. Test Coverage Completion | 1/1 | Passed | 3/3 | Gap closure ✓ |

**Total:** 7 plans, 33/33 must-haves verified

## Integration Status

**Cross-Phase Wiring:** All exports connected, 2 orphaned future features (documented)
**E2E Flows:** 3/3 complete
**Test Coverage:** 78/78 tests pass (0.05s)

### Connected Exports (11)

1. **_normalize_skill()** → used internally to build _SKILL_VARIANTS_NORMALIZED
2. **_SKILL_VARIANTS_NORMALIZED** → used by _skill_in_text() for variant lookup
3. **_skill_in_text()** → used by _score_skill_match() for fuzzy matching
4. **_score_skill_match()** → used by score_job() for skill scoring
5. **score_job()** → imported by search.py CLI
6. **load_config()** → imported by search.py, called in main() two-pass parsing
7. **DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH** → used by load_config() for default location
8. **KNOWN_KEYS** → used by load_config() for validation
9. **Two-pass CLI parsing** → implemented in search.py main()
10. **sample_profile fixture** → used by test_scoring.py
11. **job_factory fixture** → used by all test modules

### Orphaned Exports (2)

- **update_application_status()** in tracker.py (line 104) - future v2.0 feature
- **get_application_status()** in tracker.py (line 120) - future v2.0 feature
- Impact: None (forward-looking functions documented in code)

### E2E Flow Verification

#### Flow 1: Fuzzy Skill Matching
**User profile with "node.js" → job listing with "NodeJS" → correct match**
- Status: ✓ COMPLETE
- Trace: profile skill → normalize → variant lookup → pattern match → score calculation
- Verified: Cross-variant tests in Phase 5, actual execution tested

#### Flow 2: Config Defaults
**User creates config with min_score=3.0 → runs without flags → default applied**
- Status: ✓ COMPLETE
- Trace: load_config() → set_defaults() → argparse applies defaults
- Verified: Unit tests in Phase 4, two-pass parsing in search.py

#### Flow 3: Test Suite
**User runs pytest → all 78 tests pass**
- Status: ✓ COMPLETE
- Test breakdown: 43 scoring + 24 config + 11 tracker = 78 tests
- Verified: Full test run 78/78 passed in 0.05s

## Tech Debt by Phase

### Phase 2: Config File Support

**Issue:** No integration test for two-pass config parsing
- Current coverage: Unit tests validate components separately (load_config, set_defaults)
- Missing: End-to-end test of pre_parser → load_config → full parser flow
- Impact: Low (unit tests cover edge cases, manual testing confirms flow works)
- Priority: Lower (CLI-level integration, components thoroughly tested)
- Effort: 15 minutes

### Phase 3: Test Suite

**Issue:** Two orphaned functions in tracker.py
- Functions: update_application_status(), get_application_status()
- Status: Defined but never imported/called in v1.0
- Reason: Future v2.0 feature for application tracking CLI
- Impact: None (forward-looking, documented in code)
- Recommendation: Add docstring marking as "Future feature for v2.0" or move to v2.0 milestone

## Changes Since Previous Audit

**Previous audit (2026-02-09T16:00:00Z):**
- Status: tech_debt
- Test coverage: 71/72 (fuzzy variant tests missing)
- Gap: "Test gap: Fuzzy variant matching not explicitly tested in test_scoring.py"

**Current audit (2026-02-09T17:00:00Z):**
- Status: passed
- Test coverage: 78/78 (all tests pass)
- Gap closure: Phase 5 added 6 parametrized cross-variant tests
- All 4 audit-identified variant pairs now have explicit regression tests

**Resolution:**
- test_score_skill_match_fuzzy_variants function added (lines 107-140 in test_scoring.py)
- Test cases: nodejs_variant, k8s_variant, dotnet_variant, csharp_variant, python3_variant, go_boundary_with_golang
- All tests verify cross-form matching (profile skill in one form, job text in alternate form)
- Zero regressions: 72 existing tests still pass, 6 new tests added

## Anti-Patterns: None

Clean implementation across all phases:
- Zero TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments in v1.0 scope
- No stub implementations
- All tests have substantive assertions
- Proper isolation (tmp_path, capsys, patch for _TRACKER_PATH)

## Quality Metrics

**Test Suite:**
- Total tests: 78
- Pass rate: 100% (78/78)
- Execution time: 0.05s
- Coverage: All scoring functions, config edge cases, tracker isolation

**Code Quality:**
- Parametrized tests with descriptive IDs
- Factory pattern for fixtures (job_factory)
- Proper isolation (no production data touched)
- Range-based assertions for robust validation

**Integration Health:**
- Connected exports: 11/11 used correctly
- Orphaned exports: 2 (future features, documented)
- Missing connections: 0
- E2E flows: 3/3 complete

## Recommendation

**✓ Complete milestone** - System is production-ready.

All v1.0 requirements satisfied. Fuzzy skill normalization works correctly with explicit regression tests. Config file support enables persistent CLI defaults. Test suite validates all critical paths. Minor tech debt documented for future cleanup.

**Next steps:**
1. Run `/gsd:complete-milestone` to archive v1.0
2. Optional: Address tech debt in v1.1 (integration test, orphaned functions)
3. Begin v2.0 planning for new features (job aggregator API, application tracking)
