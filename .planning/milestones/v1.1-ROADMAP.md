**Phases:** 6-11
**Total Plans:** 15

## Overview

Make Job Radar accessible to non-technical users through standalone executables with interactive setup.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Core Packaging Infrastructure

**Goal**: Create working standalone executables without Python installation required
**Depends on**: v1.0 (Phase 5)
**Requirements**: PKG-01, PKG-02, PKG-03, PKG-04, PKG-05, PKG-06, PKG-07

### Phase 8: Entry Point Integration

**Goal**: Connect wizard to search pipeline with first-run detection
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: ENTRY-01, ENTRY-02, ENTRY-03, ENTRY-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User on repeat run skips wizard and goes directly to search
  2. User running python -m job_radar in development mode still works
  3. Wizard-generated profile flows into search without manual file editing
  4. Application correctly detects first-run vs repeat-run state
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Core integration: config.py profile_path, wizard writes profile_path, search.py recovery + dev flags
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — Integration tests: precedence, recovery flows, developer flags, backward compatibility

### Phase 9: Report Enhancement

**Goal**: Reports open automatically in browser with improved formatting
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: OUT-01, OUT-02, OUT-03, OUT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees report automatically open in default browser after search completes
  2. User sees report save location displayed in terminal
  3. Report renders properly in browser with improved formatting
  4. Browser opening works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — HTML report generation (Bootstrap 5, dark mode, responsive) + browser utility module
- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — Search.py integration: --no-open flag, auto_open_browser config, report messaging
- [x] 09-03-PLAN.md — Tests for report generation, browser utilities, and config integration

### Phase 10: UX Polish

**Goal**: Non-technical users see friendly progress indicators and error messages
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: UX-01, UX-02, UX-03, UX-04, UX-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees progress messages during job board fetching (1 of 4, 2 of 4, etc.)
  2. User sees friendly error messages for network failures or no jobs found (no Python tracebacks)
  3. User sees welcome message with app name and version on launch
  4. User running --help sees clear explanation of wizard and available flags
  5. User pressing Ctrl+C during wizard or search exits gracefully without traceback
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Banner, help text, and Ctrl+C handling (UX-03, UX-04, UX-05)
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — Progress indicators and friendly error handling (UX-01, UX-02)
- [x] 10-03-PLAN.md — UX test suite for all 5 requirements

### Phase 11: Distribution Automation

**Goal**: Automated multi-platform builds and release creation via GitHub Actions
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: DIST-01, DIST-02, DIST-03, DIST-04, DIST-05, DIST-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. GitHub Actions automatically builds Windows, macOS, and Linux executables on release
  2. Release page contains all three platform binaries ready for download
  3. README provides installation instructions for non-technical users
  4. README documents antivirus false positive warnings for unsigned builds
  5. Non-developer can download, extract, and run appropriate binary for their OS
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — GitHub Actions release workflow (tag-triggered multi-platform builds + release creation)
- [x] 11-02-PLAN.md — README installation guide, antivirus warnings, and quick start

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Use onedir mode for fast startup (<10s measured at 0.18s)
- Disable UPX compression to avoid antivirus false positives
- Pre-declare hidden imports (questionary, prompt_toolkit) to avoid rebuild cycles
- Use platformdirs for cross-platform data directories instead of hardcoded ~/.job-radar
- Atomic file writes with temp files + os.replace() for profile/config integrity
- Bootstrap 5 via CDN for smaller bundle size (requires internet for first HTML report load)
- Plain-text banner style for universal terminal compatibility
- Wizard-first help text as primary path (interactive setup is the expected flow)
- Source-level progress callbacks (fire twice: 'started' and 'complete')
- Tag-triggered GitHub Actions workflow (fully automated, no manual approval gates)
- Fail entire release if any platform fails (no partial releases with 2/3 platforms)

**Issues Resolved:**

- SSL certificate errors in frozen mode (fixed with certifi integration + _fix_ssl_for_frozen())
- Import errors for questionary in frozen mode (pre-declared hidden imports in .spec)
- macOS Gatekeeper warnings (documented bypass in README: right-click → Open)
- Windows SmartScreen warnings (documented bypass in README: More info → Run anyway)
- Stats dict mismatch in Phase 09 (false alarm - integration verified keys match correctly)
- Profile corruption risk (mitigated with atomic writes using temp files)

**Issues Deferred:**

- Code signing for Windows/macOS (deferred to v2.0 - requires $200-500/year certificate)
- Windows and Linux build validation (deferred to CI - GitHub Actions will test on first tag push)
- Mobile responsive layout for HTML reports (deferred to future - desktop-first approach)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - all phases delivered clean code with no TODOs, stubs, or placeholder implementations.
