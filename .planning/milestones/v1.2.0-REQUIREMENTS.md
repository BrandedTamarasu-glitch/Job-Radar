# Requirements: Job Radar

**Defined:** 2026-02-10
**Core Value:** Accurate job-candidate scoring — if the scoring is wrong, nothing else matters.

## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for v1.2.0 release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Job Source Integration

- [x] **API-01**: System integrates Adzuna API with app_id/app_key authentication — **VALIDATED** (Phase 13)
- [x] **API-02**: System integrates Authentic Jobs API with key-based authentication — **VALIDATED** (Phase 13)
- [x] **API-03**: System generates Wellfound manual search URLs (no API available) — **VALIDATED** (Phase 14)
- [x] **API-04**: System enforces rate limiting on API calls to prevent 429 errors and IP bans — **VALIDATED** (Phase 12)
- [x] **API-05**: System stores API keys securely using python-dotenv + .env file (not in code/config) — **VALIDATED** (Phase 12)
- [x] **API-06**: System maps API responses to existing JobResult dataclass format — **VALIDATED** (Phase 13)
- [x] **API-07**: System handles API failures gracefully (show other sources, log error) — **VALIDATED** (Phase 13)

### PDF Resume Import

- [x] **PDF-01**: User can upload PDF resume during wizard setup — **VALIDATED** (Phase 15)
- [x] **PDF-02**: System validates PDF is text-extractable before parsing (reject image-only PDFs) — **VALIDATED** (Phase 15)
- [x] **PDF-03**: System extracts name from PDF using pdfplumber + regex patterns — **VALIDATED** (Phase 15)
- [x] **PDF-04**: System extracts years of experience from work history dates — **VALIDATED** (Phase 15)
- [x] **PDF-05**: System extracts job titles from PDF sections — **VALIDATED** (Phase 15)
- [x] **PDF-06**: System extracts skills from PDF (technical skills, tools, languages) — **VALIDATED** (Phase 15)
- [x] **PDF-07**: System handles UTF-8 encoding for international names without crashing — **VALIDATED** (Phase 15)
- [x] **PDF-08**: User sees extracted data pre-filled in wizard with ability to edit before saving — **VALIDATED** (Phase 15)
- [x] **PDF-09**: System shows accuracy disclaimer "Please review - extraction may contain errors" — **VALIDATED** (Phase 15)
- [x] **PDF-10**: User can skip PDF import and fill wizard manually — **VALIDATED** (Phase 15)

## Future Requirements

Deferred to later milestones. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Enhanced PDF Parsing

- **PDF-11**: System uses NLP (SpaCy) for improved skill extraction accuracy (if baseline <60%)
- **PDF-12**: System extracts location/contact info from resume header
- **PDF-13**: System extracts education/degree information

### Job Source Enhancements

- **API-08**: System integrates Wellfound GraphQL API (if made public or scraped)
- **API-09**: System caches API responses with source-specific TTL
- **API-10**: System provides salary data filtering for Adzuna results

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Resume builder/editor | Out of domain - Job Radar is a search tool, not a resume tool |
| LinkedIn/Indeed direct API | No public APIs available, both sites block automation |
| Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for image PDFs | High complexity, low ROI - users can export text-based PDFs |
| AI-powered resume optimization | Scope creep, requires LLM integration and prompt engineering |
| Multi-resume support | Over-engineered for v1.2 - single profile per user is sufficient |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Final status at milestone completion.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| API-01 | Phase 13 | ✅ Complete |
| API-02 | Phase 13 | ✅ Complete |
| API-03 | Phase 14 | ✅ Complete |
| API-04 | Phase 12 | ✅ Complete |
| API-05 | Phase 12 | ✅ Complete |
| API-06 | Phase 13 | ✅ Complete |
| API-07 | Phase 13 | ✅ Complete |
| PDF-01 | Phase 15 | ✅ Complete |
| PDF-02 | Phase 15 | ✅ Complete |
| PDF-03 | Phase 15 | ✅ Complete |
| PDF-04 | Phase 15 | ✅ Complete |
| PDF-05 | Phase 15 | ✅ Complete |
| PDF-06 | Phase 15 | ✅ Complete |
| PDF-07 | Phase 15 | ✅ Complete |
| PDF-08 | Phase 15 | ✅ Complete |
| PDF-09 | Phase 15 | ✅ Complete |
| PDF-10 | Phase 15 | ✅ Complete |

**Coverage:**
- v1.2 requirements: 17 total
- Mapped to phases: 17/17 (100%)
- Unmapped: 0

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 17 of 17 v1.2.0 requirements (100%)

**Requirement Outcomes:**
- All API integration requirements (API-01 through API-07) validated in Phases 12-14
- All PDF resume parser requirements (PDF-01 through PDF-10) validated in Phase 15
- No requirements dropped or significantly adjusted during implementation
- All requirements traced to specific phases and verified through automated testing

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- API-04 (rate limiting) implemented with SQLite persistence for cross-restart state
- API-05 (credential security) uses python-dotenv with .env gitignored
- PDF-02 (validation) rejects image-only, encrypted, oversized, and corrupted PDFs with actionable errors
- PDF-07 (UTF-8 support) uses NFKC unicode normalization in pdfplumber
- PDF-10 (skip option) implemented as equal choice with "Fill manually" option
