## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status | Score |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 6 | Core Packaging Infrastructure | 3/3 | human_needed | 22/22 automated + 5 human tests |
| 7 | Interactive Setup Wizard | 2/2 | passed | 100% |
| 8 | Entry Point Integration | 2/2 | passed | 100% |
| 9 | Report Enhancement | 3/3 | passed* | 20/20 (stats mismatch resolved as false alarm) |
| 10 | UX Polish | 3/3 | passed | 100% |
| 11 | Distribution Automation | 2/2 | passed | 13/13 |

**Note on Phase 09:** Initial verification flagged stats dict mismatch, but integration checker confirmed keys match correctly (report.py returns total/new/high_score, search.py uses total/new).

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Connected Exports (9/9 verified)

All critical phase exports properly wired:

1. **Phase 6 → Multiple consumers**
   - `get_data_dir`: config.py, wizard.py (2x), search.py
   - `get_log_file`: banner.py
   - `display_banner`: __main__.py
   - `log_error_and_exit`: __main__.py
   - `log_error_to_file`: search.py (2x)

2. **Phase 7 → Entry point and recovery**
   - `run_setup_wizard`: __main__.py, search.py (5 recovery points)
   - `is_first_run`: __main__.py

3. **Phase 9 → Search orchestration**
   - `generate_report`: search.py
   - `open_report_in_browser`: search.py

### Integration Quality Metrics

- Total Exports: 14
- Connected (Production): 9 ✓
- Connected (Internal/Test): 5 ✓
- Orphaned: 0 ✓
- Missing Connections: 0 ✓

**Status:** ✓ PASS

## End-to-End Flows

All 5 user flows verified complete with no breaks:

### Flow 1: First-Run Setup ✓ COMPLETE
**Path:** User runs job-radar → wizard checks profile → runs setup → writes profile.json/config.json → continues to search
**Key wiring:** __main__.py:77 → wizard.is_first_run(), wizard.py:475-476 → atomic writes
**Verified:** Banner displays, wizard prompts sequentially, files written atomically, no breaks

### Flow 2: Search Execution ✓ COMPLETE
**Path:** Load profile → fetch sources (with progress) → filter dates → score jobs → track seen → generate report
**Key wiring:** search.py:489 → load_profile_with_recovery(), search.py:562 → sources.fetch_all()
**Verified:** Progress callbacks work, profile recovery triggers wizard, pipeline completes

### Flow 3: Report Generation & Browser ✓ COMPLETE
**Path:** Generate HTML + Markdown → return paths/stats → display summary → open browser (if not headless)
**Key wiring:** report.py:83-87 → returns dict, search.py:687 → open_report_in_browser()
**Verified:** Stats dict compatible, browser opens unless headless, no breaks

### Flow 4: Error Handling ✓ COMPLETE
**Path:** Fatal error → log to file → display error + log location → exit(1)
**Key wiring:** __main__.py:100 → log_error_and_exit(), banner.py:46-53 → get_log_file()
**Verified:** Fatal errors log and exit, non-fatal errors log but continue

### Flow 5: Distribution (CI/CD) ✓ COMPLETE
**Path:** Tag v* → run tests → build with PyInstaller → create archives → GitHub release
**Key wiring:** release.yml:5-6 → v* trigger, release.yml:69 → pyinstaller job-radar.spec
**Verified:** Test gating (needs: test), multi-platform matrix, spec references correct entry point

## Human Verification Items

### Platform Testing (5 items)

These tests require actual hardware/OS environments not available during automated verification:

1. **Windows .exe on fresh Windows system**
   - Expected: Application launches, banner displays, help text shows
   - Why manual: Windows build untested (macOS host)

2. **Linux binary on fresh Linux system**
   - Expected: Application launches, banner displays, help text shows
   - Why manual: Linux build untested (macOS host)

3. **Full job search on frozen executable**
   - Expected: Search completes, report generates, no SSL errors
   - Why manual: Requires real network requests and profile creation

4. **Test on different macOS version**
   - Expected: Works on macOS 11+ without Python
   - Why manual: Cross-version compatibility

5. **Startup time perception**
   - Expected: Feels responsive, under 10 seconds
   - Why manual: User experience validation beyond programmatic timing

**Mitigation:** GitHub Actions workflow (Phase 11) will test Windows/Linux builds on first tag push (v1.1.0). CI provides platform coverage that manual testing couldn't.

---

## Tech Debt

None identified. All phases delivered clean code with no TODOs, stubs, or deferred items.

---

## Critical Gaps

None identified. All requirements satisfied, all flows complete, all wiring verified.

---

## Recommendations

### For v1.1 Release

1. **Deploy with confidence** - All critical paths verified, no blocking issues
2. **Monitor first CI run** - Windows/Linux builds configured but not manually tested
   - Tag push: `git tag v1.1.0 && git push origin v1.1.0`
   - GitHub Actions will automatically test and build all platforms
3. **Manual validation after CI** - Download and test Windows/Linux executables from first release

### For Future Milestones

1. Consider bundling resources (CSS/images) using `get_resource_path()` infrastructure (already implemented in Phase 6)
2. Add integration tests that exercise full E2E flows
3. Manual Windows validation recommended before major releases
