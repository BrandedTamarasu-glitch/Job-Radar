# Requirements: Job Radar

**Defined:** 2026-02-07
**Core Value:** Accurate job-candidate scoring -- if the scoring is wrong, nothing else matters.

## v1 Requirements

### Testing

- [x] **TEST-01**: Scoring unit tests cover all `_score_*` functions with parametrized edge cases
- [x] **TEST-02**: Dealbreaker detection tests verify exact match, substring, and case-insensitive behavior
- [x] **TEST-03**: Salary parsing tests cover formats: "$120k", "$60/hr", "$120,000", ranges, and "Not listed"
- [x] **TEST-04**: Tracker `job_key()` tests verify stable dedup key generation
- [x] **TEST-05**: Tracker `mark_seen()` tests verify new/seen annotation with tmp_path isolation
- [x] **TEST-06**: Tracker `get_stats()` tests verify aggregation logic
- [x] **TEST-07**: Shared conftest.py with sample profile and JobResult fixtures

### Fuzzy Matching

- [x] **FUZZ-01**: `_normalize_skill()` function strips punctuation, lowercases, and collapses whitespace
- [x] **FUZZ-02**: Normalized lookup in `_skill_in_text()` so "NodeJS" matches "node.js"
- [x] **FUZZ-03**: `_BOUNDARY_SKILLS` protection preserved — short skills (go, r, c) use word-boundary matching only
- [x] **FUZZ-04**: No regressions on existing `_SKILL_VARIANTS` matches
- [x] **FUZZ-05**: Expanded `_SKILL_VARIANTS` dict with missing common tech variants

### Config

- [x] **CONF-01**: JSON config file at `~/.job-radar/config.json` for persistent CLI defaults
- [x] **CONF-02**: CLI flags always override config values (set_defaults pattern)
- [x] **CONF-03**: Graceful behavior when no config file exists — tool works identically to today
- [x] **CONF-04**: `--config` flag to specify custom config file path
- [x] **CONF-05**: Config validation catches unknown keys with helpful error messages

## v2 Requirements

### Testing Expansion

- **TEST-V2-01**: Cache module tests (read/write, TTL expiry) with tmp_path isolation
- **TEST-V2-02**: pytest-cov integration for coverage tracking
- **TEST-V2-03**: Source parser tests with HTML fixture snapshots

### Job Data Aggregation

- **DATA-01**: JSearch (RapidAPI) or SerpAPI integration for LinkedIn/Indeed coverage
- **DATA-02**: API key configuration via config file
- **DATA-03**: Source-specific cache TTL settings

### Application Tracking CLI

- **TRACK-01**: `job-radar apply <title> <company>` command to track application status
- **TRACK-02**: `job-radar status` command to view application pipeline

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| LinkedIn/Indeed direct scraping | Both sites aggressively block automation; unreliable |
| Web UI or email digest | CLI + Markdown report is the current workflow |
| rapidfuzz dependency | Normalization-based approach covers the problem without new runtime deps |
| TOML config format | Requires tomli backport for Python 3.10; JSON is zero-dep and already used |
| Mobile app | Desktop CLI tool |
| Scoring weight customization | Deferred -- current weights work; tune after test suite validates them |

**Coverage:**
- v1 requirements: 17 total
- Shipped in v1.0: 17/17 (100%)
- Requirements adjusted: 0
- Requirements dropped: 0

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 17 of 17 v1 requirements

**Outcomes:**
- ✓ All fuzzy matching requirements validated through cross-variant tests (Phase 5 closure)
- ✓ All config requirements validated through 24 edge case tests (Phase 4 closure)
- ✓ All test suite requirements validated with 78/78 tests passing
- ✓ Zero requirements adjusted or dropped during implementation

**Adjusted:** None - all requirements shipped as originally specified

**Dropped:** None - all v1 requirements completed

**Tech Debt:**
- Minor: No integration test for two-pass config parsing (lower priority)
- Minor: Two orphaned functions in tracker.py for future v2.0 features
