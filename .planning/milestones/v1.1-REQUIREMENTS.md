# Requirements: Job Radar

**Defined:** 2026-02-09
**Core Value:** Accurate job-candidate scoring — if the scoring is wrong, nothing else matters.

## v1.1 Requirements (Standalone Executable)

### Executable Packaging

- [x] **PKG-01**: Standalone Windows .exe executable that runs without Python installation
- [x] **PKG-02**: Standalone macOS .app executable that runs without Python installation
- [x] **PKG-03**: Standalone Linux binary that runs without Python installation
- [x] **PKG-04**: Executable uses PyInstaller onedir mode for fast startup (<10 seconds)
- [x] **PKG-05**: All dependencies bundled (requests, BeautifulSoup, questionary)
- [x] **PKG-06**: Resource files (templates, data) accessible via sys._MEIPASS pattern
- [x] **PKG-07**: Hidden imports explicitly declared in .spec file

### First-Run Setup Wizard

- [x] **WIZ-01**: Detect first run by checking for ~/.job-radar/profile.json existence
- [x] **WIZ-02**: Launch interactive setup wizard on first run before search
- [x] **WIZ-03**: Prompt for user's name with example ("John Doe")
- [x] **WIZ-04**: Prompt for skills with examples ("Python, JavaScript, React, AWS")
- [x] **WIZ-05**: Prompt for target job titles with examples ("Software Engineer, Full Stack Developer")
- [x] **WIZ-06**: Prompt for location preference with examples ("Remote, New York, Hybrid")
- [x] **WIZ-07**: Prompt for dealbreakers with examples ("relocation required, on-site only")
- [x] **WIZ-08**: Prompt for minimum job score (1-5 scale, default 2.8)
- [x] **WIZ-09**: Prompt for new-only filter preference (yes/no, default yes)
- [x] **WIZ-10**: Validate all inputs inline before proceeding (non-empty name, at least one skill/title)
- [x] **WIZ-11**: Auto-generate ~/.job-radar/profile.json from wizard responses
- [x] **WIZ-12**: Auto-generate ~/.job-radar/config.json from preference responses
- [x] **WIZ-13**: Use Questionary library for interactive prompts with validation

### Entry Point Integration

- [x] **ENTRY-01**: Create main.py entry point for frozen executable (checks sys.frozen)
- [x] **ENTRY-02**: Refactor search.py to expose run_search(profile_dict) function
- [x] **ENTRY-03**: Wizard → run_search() integration in main.py
- [x] **ENTRY-04**: Backward compatibility: python -m job_radar still works for development

### Output Enhancement

- [x] **OUT-01**: Improve Markdown report formatting for browser rendering
- [x] **OUT-02**: Auto-open report in default browser after generation
- [x] **OUT-03**: Display report save location in terminal/console
- [x] **OUT-04**: Use webbrowser.open() for cross-platform browser launching

### UX Improvements

- [x] **UX-01**: Display progress indicators during job board fetching (4 sources)
- [x] **UX-02**: Show friendly error messages for common failures (network errors, no jobs found)
- [x] **UX-03**: Display welcome message with app name and version on launch
- [x] **UX-04**: Provide --help text explaining wizard and flags
- [x] **UX-05**: Graceful handling of Ctrl+C during wizard or search

### Distribution Automation

- [x] **DIST-01**: GitHub Actions workflow for Windows executable build
- [x] **DIST-02**: GitHub Actions workflow for macOS executable build
- [x] **DIST-03**: GitHub Actions workflow for Linux executable build
- [x] **DIST-04**: Automated release creation with all platform binaries attached
- [x] **DIST-05**: README with installation instructions for non-technical users
- [x] **DIST-06**: README documents antivirus false positive warnings (unsigned builds)

## v2 Requirements (Future)

### Code Signing

- **SIGN-01**: Code signing certificate for Windows (removes SmartScreen warnings)
- **SIGN-02**: Apple Developer ID for macOS (removes Gatekeeper warnings)
- **SIGN-03**: Automated signing in CI/CD pipeline

### HTML Reports

- **HTML-01**: Jinja2-based HTML report generation
- **HTML-02**: Inline CSS styling for professional appearance
- **HTML-03**: Interactive filtering/sorting in browser
- **HTML-04**: Choice between HTML and Markdown output formats

### Advanced UX

- **ADV-01**: Reconfiguration command to re-run wizard without deleting profile
- **ADV-02**: Summary page showing profile/config before search
- **ADV-03**: Update notification mechanism
- **ADV-04**: Pre-populated skill suggestions based on job title input

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| GUI window for main app | Browser + Markdown is sufficient; avoid Tkinter/Qt complexity |
| Embedded browser for reports | System browser works; avoid Electron/WebView2 bloat |
| Cloud profile sync | Local-first tool; sync adds server dependencies |
| Auto-update mechanism | Manual updates acceptable for v1.1; defer to v2 |
| Mobile app | Desktop tool for desktop job search workflow |
| Profile import from LinkedIn | API restrictions; too complex for v1.1 |
