<objective>
Verify the complete Phase 28 deliverable: dual entry point detection, GUI window rendering, and non-blocking threading.

Purpose: Human confirms the GUI foundation works correctly before Phase 29 adds real features on top.

Output: User approval to proceed to Phase 29.

  <action>
Human verification of the complete Phase 28 GUI foundation. No code changes — this is a visual/functional verification checkpoint.

What was built:
- CustomTkinter main window (700x500, system theme, header with "Job Radar" title)
- Dual entry point: GUI when no args, CLI when args present
- Tabbed layout with Profile and Search tabs
- Welcome screen (if no profile) or profile summary (if profile exists)
- Non-blocking threading with queue-based communication
- Mock 10+ second search operation with progress display
- Cancel button and modal error dialogs
- Separate CLI (console) and GUI (no console) PyInstaller executables
  </action>
  <verify>
**Test 1: CLI mode still works**
1. Run `python -m job_radar --help` in terminal
2. Expected: CLI help text prints, no GUI window opens

**Test 2: GUI launches with no args**
1. Run `python -m job_radar` (no arguments)
2. Expected: CustomTkinter window opens (700x500, follows system dark/light theme)
3. Verify: Header shows "Job Radar" with version number
4. Verify: Window has "Profile" and "Search" tabs

**Test 3: Welcome screen OR profile summary**
- If no profile exists: Welcome screen with description text and "Get Started" button
- If profile exists: Profile tab shows profile data (name, skills, titles, etc.)

**Test 4: Threading responsiveness**
1. Navigate to Search tab
2. Click "Run Search" button (or verify it's disabled with "Profile required" message if no profile)
3. If enabled: Click "Run Search"
4. Expected: Progress bar appears with source names ("Fetching Dice...", etc.)
5. **CRITICAL**: Try to move/resize the window during the operation — it must remain responsive
6. Wait for completion (~12 seconds) — UI should reset to idle

**Test 5: Cancel button**
1. Start the mock search again
2. Click "Cancel" before it finishes
3. Expected: Operation stops, UI shows "Search cancelled" briefly, then resets

**Test 6: Window appearance**
- Verify the window looks reasonable (not broken layout, text is readable)
- Verify it follows your system theme (dark mode if system is dark, light if light)
  </verify>
  <done>User types "approved" confirming all six tests pass, or describes issues for gap closure.</done>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all tests pass, or describe any issues</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Human confirmation that:
1. CLI passthrough works (--help prints help, no GUI)
2. GUI window opens on bare invocation
3. Window remains responsive during 10+ second mock operation
4. Progress display updates correctly
5. Cancel button works
6. Appearance follows system theme

<success_criteria>
User approves the GUI foundation. All six verification tests pass.
</success_criteria>
