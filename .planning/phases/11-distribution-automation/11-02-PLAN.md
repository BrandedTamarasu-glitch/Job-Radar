<objective>
Update README.md with non-technical installation instructions for all platforms, prominent antivirus false positive warnings, and a quick start guide showing the wizard-first flow.

Purpose: The README is the first thing users see on GitHub. Without clear installation instructions and antivirus warnings, non-technical users will be blocked or scared off by SmartScreen/Gatekeeper.
Output: Updated `README.md` with Installation, Warnings, and Quick Start sections

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite README.md with installation guide and antivirus warnings</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite README.md to serve both non-technical users (who download executables) and developers (who clone the repo). The README must be restructured with the primary audience being non-technical users who find the project on GitHub.

**New README structure (top to bottom):**

**1. Header and description**
- "# Job Radar" title
- One-line description: searches job boards, scores listings against your profile, generates ranked reports
- Brief feature highlights (multi-source search, skill matching, interactive setup wizard, HTML reports)

**2. Installation section** (DIST-05)
- Section: `## Installation`
- Subsection: `### Download` — Link to GitHub Releases page (use relative `../../releases/latest` path or `https://github.com/BrandedTamarasu-glitch/Job-Radar/releases/latest`). Explain which file to download for each OS:
  - Windows: `job-radar-vX.X.X-windows.zip`
  - macOS: `job-radar-vX.X.X-macos.zip`
  - Linux: `job-radar-vX.X.X-linux.tar.gz`

- **Antivirus/Security Warning** (DIST-06) — Place as a prominent blockquote or callout IMMEDIATELY after the download subsection, BEFORE platform instructions. Users must see this before they download. Content:
  - Explain these are unsigned builds (code signing costs ~$300/year)
  - This is normal for open-source tools distributed as executables
  - Windows SmartScreen: Click "More info" then "Run anyway"
  - macOS Gatekeeper: Right-click the app, then click "Open"
  - Antivirus software may flag it as suspicious — this is a false positive common with PyInstaller-packaged applications

- Subsection: `### Windows` — Step-by-step:
  1. Download `job-radar-vX.X.X-windows.zip` from Releases
  2. Right-click the ZIP > Extract All
  3. Open the `job-radar` folder
  4. Double-click `job-radar.exe`
  5. The setup wizard will guide you through creating your profile

- Subsection: `### macOS` — Step-by-step:
  1. Download `job-radar-vX.X.X-macos.zip` from Releases
  2. Double-click to extract
  3. Drag `JobRadar.app` to your Applications folder (optional)
  4. Right-click the app and select "Open" (required on first launch)
  5. Click "Open" in the security dialog
  6. The setup wizard will guide you through creating your profile

- Subsection: `### Linux` — Step-by-step:
  1. Download `job-radar-vX.X.X-linux.tar.gz` from Releases
  2. Extract: `tar -xzf job-radar-vX.X.X-linux.tar.gz`
  3. Run: `./job-radar/job-radar`
  4. If permission denied: `chmod +x job-radar/job-radar`
  5. The setup wizard will guide you through creating your profile

**3. Quick Start section**
- Section: `## Quick Start`
- Explain the first-run wizard flow: launch the app, follow the prompts to enter your name, skills, job titles, location, dealbreakers, and search preferences
- After wizard completes, the search runs automatically
- On subsequent launches, search runs directly (no wizard)
- Mention `--help` flag for all available options

**4. Score Ratings table** (keep existing)

**5. Command Reference** (keep existing, but update for new flags)
- Keep the flag table but update it to reflect current flags (--no-open, --no-wizard, etc.)
- Keep examples section

**6. Development section** (for contributors/developers)
- Section: `## Development`
- Subsection: `### From Source` — Instructions for developers: clone, `pip install -e .`, `python -m job_radar`
- Subsection: `### Running Tests` — Keep existing pytest instructions
- Subsection: `### Building Executables` — Reference `scripts/build.sh` and `scripts/build.bat`

**7. Further Reading** (keep existing links to WORKFLOW.md and CHANGELOG.md)

**Tone and style per CONTEXT.md decisions:**
- Assume zero technical background for installation sections
- Use plain language: "download this file", "double-click to extract", "open the app"
- Antivirus warning explains WHY (unsigned binary) and HOW to proceed
- Quick start shows wizard-first flow as primary path (matches Phase 10 help text)

**Do NOT:**
- Remove useful information from the existing README (keep score ratings, command reference, examples)
- Add emojis
- Add badges or shields
- Reference code signing (deferred to v2)
- Include screenshots (we don't have them)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Read the final README.md and verify all required sections exist:
   - Installation with Download, Windows, macOS, Linux subsections
   - Antivirus/security warning callout positioned before platform instructions
   - Quick Start section describing wizard flow
   - Score Ratings table
   - Command Reference with flags
   - Development section with "From Source" instructions
2. Verify SmartScreen bypass instructions: "More info" then "Run anyway"
3. Verify Gatekeeper bypass instructions: right-click, Open
4. Verify archive naming pattern matches CONTEXT.md: `job-radar-{version}-{platform}.{ext}`
5. Verify .zip for Windows/macOS, .tar.gz for Linux
  </verify>
  <done>
README.md contains:
- Clear installation instructions for all 3 platforms targeting non-technical users
- Prominent antivirus/SmartScreen/Gatekeeper warning with bypass steps
- Quick start guide showing wizard-first flow
- Preserved developer documentation (from source, tests, building)
- Score ratings and command reference retained
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. README.md has `## Installation` section with platform-specific subsections
2. Antivirus warning appears between Download and platform instructions
3. Windows instructions mention SmartScreen bypass: "More info" → "Run anyway"
4. macOS instructions mention Gatekeeper bypass: right-click → Open
5. Quick Start describes the setup wizard flow
6. Development section preserves clone/install/test instructions for developers
7. All existing useful content (scores, flags, examples) retained
</verification>

<success_criteria>
A non-technical user visiting the GitHub repository can:
1. Find the download link for their platform
2. Understand the antivirus warning before it appears
3. Follow step-by-step instructions to install and launch the app
4. Understand the wizard will guide them through setup
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/11-distribution-automation/11-02-SUMMARY.md`
